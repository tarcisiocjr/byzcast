# ByzCast

**ByzCast** is a proof of concept of a partial-genuine byzantine atomic multicast protocol using as base to implementation the library **[BFT-SMaRt][1]**. 
The idea behind this project is simple: we use multiple groups of instances of BFT-SMART and the data are partitioned between these groups. 
Messages addressed only to one group are routed locally and messages addressed to multiple groups are forwarded to a global group. 
After the global consensus the message is forwarded to the corresponding local(s) group(s).

## Installation

This project requires Java Runtime Environment 1.8 and Maven. 
To compile:
   
    mvn package


## Usage

Sample scripts to run both server and client side can be found in the ``script`` folder.

### History

This project started as a simple proof of concept that is possible to construct a partial-genuine atomic multicast protocol using the classic approach in broadcast consensus protocols currently available, 
in this case [BFT-SMaRt][1] library, a replication library written in Java designed to tolerate Byzantine fault that implements state machine replication.

The basic idea behind this PoC started by deploying
